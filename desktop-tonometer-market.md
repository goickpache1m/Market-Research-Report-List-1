<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desktop Tonometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Noncontact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Desktop Tonometer market is primarily categorized into two types: contact and non-contact tonometers. Contact tonometers require direct contact with the eye to measure intraocular pressure, providing precise readings but necessitating careful hygiene practices. In contrast, non-contact tonometers use an air puff to assess eye pressure without touching the eye, enhancing patient comfort and reducing infection risk. Both types are essential in diagnosing and managing glaucoma, with distinct advantages suited to different clinical settings and patient needs.</p></p>
